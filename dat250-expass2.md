* **Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved them:**

  not a technical problem, but more of a question: <br>
seeing as the @NoArgsConstructor is used in the example-entities, should we use it in the implementation as well, or should we use a parameterized(?) constructor (seeing as we need constructors w arguments when it's time to make the objects)?

* **A link to your code for experiment 2 above. Make sure the included test case passes!:**

* **An explanation of how you inspected the database tables:**


* **what tables were created, screenshots:**

Questions:

**Where is the database? Explain the used database and how/when it runs.** 
<br>when we look at persistence.xml we can see that:
* the database is located at this url:

**Can you provide the SQL used to create the table Customer (Hint: Hibernate is used for the object-relational-mapping)?**

```
Hibernate: 
    create table Customer (
        id bigint generated by default as identity,
        primary key (id)
    )
```


**Find a way to inspect the database tables being created and attach a screenshot of the database schema to your report. Do the created tables correspond to your initial thoughts regarding the exercise?**
