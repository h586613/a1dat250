Questions:

Where is the database? Explain the used database and how/when it runs.


Can you provide the SQL used to create the table Customer (Hint: Hibernate is used for the object-relational-mapping)?

Hibernate: 
    create table Customer (
        id bigint generated by default as identity,
        primary key (id)
    )


Find a way to inspect the database tables being created and attach a screenshot of the database schema to your report. Do the created tables correspond to your initial thoughts regarding the exercise?
